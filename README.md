## Step 01: Hello World
It's in the branch [Step-01_Hello-World](https://github.com/joergi/learning-typescript/tree/Step-01_Hello-World)

A running example , a Hello World.    
Start it with  `npm run start`

## Step 02: Call funtion in different class
It's in the branch [Step-02_call-function](https://github.com/joergi/learning-typescript/tree/Step-02_call-function)

In step 2 we have a new class, called: `otherclass.ts`   
There is a private function `privateFunction()` and the public function `publicFunction()`;
The public function is called from the `index.ts`     

## Step 03: Method Overloading
It's in the branch [Step-02_call-function](https://github.com/joergi/learning-typescript/tree/Step_03-_methode-overloading)

in the step 3 we use method overloading, it all in the class: `methodOverloading.ts`    
there are some rules:    
* return type must be equal
* if the numbers of arguments are equal, the types of arguments must be different
* if the type of arguments are equal, the number of argument must be different
